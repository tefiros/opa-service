# OPA Evaluation Service

This project exposes a simple **FastAPI** service that connects to **OPA (Open Policy Agent)** using the [opa-python-client](https://pypi.org/project/opa-python-client/).
It provides a single endpoint `/evaluate` where you can send input data to evaluate policies registered in OPA.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **POST /evaluate** → Evaluate a policy given its path and input data.
- Uses **FastAPI** for the REST API.
- Uses **opa-python-client** for communication with OPA.
- Includes Docker support and automated tests.

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python **3.11+**
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#running-opa) running in server mode

---

## 🛠️ Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/opa-service.git
cd opa-service

## 🛠️ Environmental variables

These are the environmental variables that can be configured:

| **Variable** |                        **Description**                        |
| :----------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  `OPA_HOSTNAME`  |       Hostname where the OPA service is running and reachable.       |
|    `OPA_PORT`    | Port number (String) where the OPA service is running and reachable. |

When installing the Helm Chart, upgrade it with a custom `myvalues.yaml` file where you define the environmental variables that you wish to override.
